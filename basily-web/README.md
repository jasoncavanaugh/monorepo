# Basily

Somewhere between Excel and most budgeting apps that try to do too much (YNAB, NerdWallet, etc.). Originally made for my own personal use.


# Notes

Because I wasn't able to get pnpm catalogs working in Railway, it is of critical importance that all packages use the same version of React. 
Stuff gets weird and difficult to debug otherwise.
